# My current setup

## IDE 
PhpStorm, WebStorm and VSCode

## Terminal
I saved all terminal settings to [my dotfiles repo](https://github.com/datcal/dotfiles.git)

My prefer is [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) with [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) and [fig](https://fig.io/)

### These are some of the apps I’m using

- To run projects locally I use Laravel Sail.
- I love <3 [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and [RayCast](https://www.raycast.com/). I use Alfred for general purpose. I'm using many workflows. Google Meet by [Albin Groen](https://albingroen.com) to creating google meet links. IP Address by [Alex Chan](https://github.com/alexchantastic/alfred-ip-address-workflow/) to get network informations and Laravel Docs by [Till Krüss](https://till.im) to search the Laravel docs.

- To connect to ftp and sftp servers I use [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a great API testing and documentation app.
Moom is used to quickly resize windows quarter, half and full screen.
Databases are managed with SequelPro
MySQLWorkbench is used to draw ERDs. Even though the interface is a bit sucky, it does the job.
My favourite cloud storage solution is Dropbox. All my personal documents are on there and at Spatie we use it extensively too.
If you’re not using a password manager, you’re doing it wrong. I use 1Password. Personal passwords are sync in a vault stored on Dropbox. For Spatie we have a team account.
All settings of my apps are backupped to Dropbox through Mackup. This is a fantastic piece of software that moves all your preferences to Dropbox and symlinks them.
I don’t use Time Machine, my backups are handled with Backblaze.
Tweets are tweeted with Tweetbot.
I read a lot of blogs through RSS feeds in Reeder.
Mails are read and written in Mailplane, a wrapper around the Gmail web interface.
My browser of choice is Google Chrome. To block ads on certain sites I use the Ghostery plugin.
I like to write long blogposts in iA Writer
Calendars are managed in Fantastical 2
I don’t often publish videos, but when I do, I create them using ScreenFlow.
Even though I’m not a designer I sometimes have to edit images. For this I use Pixelmator.
To quickly change the volume in iTunes I use SizzlingKeys.
GrandPerspective is a hidden gem that helps you determine how your disk space is being use used.
I have a band. We do all our recording ourselves. For this I use Reaper.
